# Example of using Boost.Cobalt with Boost.Asio

I've been experimenting with these libraries recently and decided to share the results here.

I used `Boost 1.84.0` and `GCC 13.2.0` to run the program.

Also check [Boost.Cobalt](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/libs/cobalt/doc/html/index.html) and [Boost.Asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) documentation.
